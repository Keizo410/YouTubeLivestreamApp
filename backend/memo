1. Subscription service
- get channelID, channelName, youtuber name from user input
- store it for livestream tracking in the backend database tables

2. About section

3. Analysis section
- Analysis of each registered youtube channels livestreaming info
- the amount of money they earned at specific session
- user list of superchat and comment
- comment analysis of the session (negative? positive?)



Architecture & Components
Dashboard Design

Create a responsive, modern dashboard with multiple views (overview, detailed metrics, predictions, reports)
Use interactive data visualizations with filtering capabilities
Implement real-time updates using WebSockets or server-sent events
Include customizable widgets that users can arrange to prioritize metrics they care about

ML Model Ecosystem

Comment Sentiment Analyzer

Process incoming comments in real-time to detect sentiment
Identify emotional trends during different stream segments
Flag potential moderation issues or toxic comments


Engagement Predictor

Forecast viewer counts and engagement levels for upcoming streams
Identify what stream titles, thumbnails, and descriptions correlate with higher engagement
Suggest optimal stream duration based on historical data


Donation Pattern Detector

Identify what triggers donations (content types, interactions, time of day)
Predict donation peaks during streams
Recommend strategies to increase monetization


Audience Retention Analyzer

Track when viewers typically join and leave streams
Identify content that keeps viewers watching longer
Suggest content pacing adjustments based on retention patterns



Real-time Visualizations

Heat maps showing comment activity throughout streams
Sentiment trend graphs updating in real-time
Live donation tracking with predictive overlays
Audience fluctuation charts with annotations for key moments

Automated Reporting System

Weekly/monthly performance summaries
Comparative analysis against previous periods
Personalized growth recommendations
Competitor benchmarking (if you track multiple channels)

Alert System

Customizable threshold-based alerts (e.g., unusual spikes in viewers, sentiment shifts)
Milestone notifications (subscribers, donation goals)
Anomaly detection for unexpected patterns
Scheduled predictive alerts before planned streams

Implementation Strategy

Start by building a solid data pipeline that can handle real-time processing
Implement the ML models one by one, beginning with the most impactful
Create a basic version of the dashboard with essential visualizations
Add the reporting and alert systems
Continuously refine models based on accumulated data

This project would demonstrate advanced skills in data engineering, machine learning, real-time systems, UX design, and business intelligence - making it an impressive high-level portfolio piece that showcases both technical ability and business value creation.
